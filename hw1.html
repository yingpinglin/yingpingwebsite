Hello. I'm Ying Ping. I am currently a lost person, still exploring and finding new things that interest me. I would love to see where my path in art will take me. Even though I am a lazy person who likes to stay at home every day, I believe in the power of creativity to open new doors and help me see the world in a different ways.
</p>
<p>
I like playing games, scrolling through social media, listening to music and noticing little things that catch my eye. For me, art is not about being perfect but about expressing feelings and trying out ideas. I hope that by experimenting, I will discover my own voice and style. My journey may be slow, but I know that every step brings me closer to understanding who I am.
