I wanted this photo of an exit sign to pop out and give a bit horror vibes, so I changed the brightness lower and contrast to the max made the everything but the word exit dark. I also adjusted the vibrance and saturation to the max puts a glow and popout on the word exit. And lastly the color balance, the midtones was shifted to Red and Blue making the light turn red around the exit sign.

First, I added a contrast making the photo more dim and old looking. Then, I added some offset and gamma correction to make the words red letters more noticable. Lastly, I played with curves which helped make the fire look like its been through a fire witht the scratches.
