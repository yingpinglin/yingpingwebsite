<h1>Homework Assignment 3: Depth of Field</h1>
<p>The first image a deep depth of field where the image is a clear view of everything in the photo taken from the camera. The second photo taken from the camera is shallow depth of feild of the plastic water bottle. The thrid photo is an edited photo of the deep depth of feild to look like the second photo but making the bottle pop out way more then expected having us focusing only on the bottle. </p>

<p>This is a shallow depth of field of the pringles on a table. The lighting of the photo is underexposed so to edit it into a natural exposed photo. In photoshop, I use an Filter effect called Camera Raw Filter. Using it on the photo allowed me to increase and decrease the settings to make my photo become natural exposure for a better view of the items in it.</p>

<p>This is similar to the pringles on the table but it is a shallow depth of field on the glasses on the table. It is underexposed so I do the same filter previously to neturalize the exposure of the photo.</p>
