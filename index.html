<h1>YingPing's Profoilio</h1>

<p>Hi! My name is Ying Ping. I grew up in Brooklyn, New York. I am Chinese American, and both my parents and my environment have shaped how I see the world. Living in Brooklyn exposed me to many different things, while watching Chinese dramas and reality shows I enjoyed the emotions, humor, and everyday life of the characters. My most memorable moment is staying up late at night playing catan or monopoly with my siblings on the 4th of July. </p>
<p>I see myself as a “still looking for what interests me” artist who is still learning and exploring different paths I could take. I do not know exactly what kind of artist I want to become yet, but I am excited about the journey and the discoveries that will come with it. </p>
<p>I grew up loving movies, games, and creative projects. Action films caught my attention most with their bold energy, while comedy and slice-of-life stories showed me how simple moments can hold deep meaning. I also enjoy playing casual games and board games, which remind me how creativity and fun can bring people together. Gaming with friends has shaped my view of media, because it showed me that stories and visuals are not only entertainment, but also a way to build connections. </p>
<p>I am drawn to modern and futuristic styles because they feel fresh, dynamic, and exciting. Title sequences, bold graphics, and digital media inspire me to experiment with ways of setting moods and creating emotion through design. I hope to create work that not only entertains, but also reflects real human emotions and experiences. </p>
<p>Thank you for reading. ~ YingPing</p>
